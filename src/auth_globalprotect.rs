/* We would like to #include any system header file which could define
   iconv_t, 1. in order to eliminate the risk that the user gets compilation
   errors because some other system header file includes /usr/include/iconv.h
   which defines iconv_t or declares iconv after this file, 2. when compiling
   for LIBICONV_PLUG, we need the proper iconv_t type in order to produce
   binary compatible code.
   But gcc's #include_next is not portable. Thus, once libiconv's iconv.h
   has been installed in /usr/local/include, there is no way any more to
   include the original /usr/include/iconv.h. We simply have to get away
   without it.
   Ad 1. The risk that a system header file does
   #include "iconv.h"  or  #include_next "iconv.h"
   is small. They all do #include <iconv.h>.
   Ad 2. The iconv_t type is a pointer type in all cases I have seen. (It
   has to be a scalar type because (iconv_t)(-1) is a possible return value
   from iconv_open().) */

 * Network Service Type for option SO_NET_SERVICE_TYPE
 *
 * The vast majority of sockets should use Best Effort that is the default
 * Network Service Type. Other Network Service Types have to be used only if
 * the traffic actually matches the description of the Network Service Type.
 *
 * Network Service Types do not represent priorities but rather describe
 * different categories of delay, jitter and loss parameters.
 * Those parameters may influence protocols from layer 4 protocols like TCP
 * to layer 2 protocols like Wi-Fi. The Network Service Type can determine
 * how the traffic is queued and scheduled by the host networking stack and
 * by other entities on the network like switches and routers. For example
 * for Wi-Fi, the Network Service Type can select the marking of the
 * layer 2 packet with the appropriate WMM Access Category.
 *
 * There is no point in attempting to game the system and use
 * a Network Service Type that does not correspond to the actual
 * traffic characteristic but one that seems to have a higher precedence.
 * The reason is that for service classes that have lower tolerance
 * for delay and jitter, the queues size is lower than for service
 * classes that are more tolerant to delay and jitter.
 *
 * For example using a voice service type for bulk data transfer will lead
 * to disastrous results as soon as congestion happens because the voice
 * queue overflows and packets get dropped. This is not only bad for the bulk
 * data transfer but it is also bad for VoIP apps that legitimately are using
 * the voice  service type.
 *
 * The characteristics of the Network Service Types are based on the service
 * classes defined in RFC 4594 "Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service
 * Classes"
 *
 * When system detects the outgoing interface belongs to a DiffServ domain
 * that follows the recommendation of the IETF draft "Guidelines for DiffServ to
 * IEEE 802.11 Mapping", the packet will marked at layer 3 with a DSCP value
 * that corresponds to Network Service Type.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BE
 *	"Best Effort", unclassified/standard.  This is the default service
 *	class and cover the majority of the traffic.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BK
 *	"Background", high delay tolerant, loss tolerant. elastic flow,
 *	variable size & long-lived. E.g: non-interactive network bulk transfer
 *	like synching or backup.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RD
 *	"Responsive Data", a notch higher than "Best Effort", medium delay
 *	tolerant, elastic & inelastic flow, bursty, long-lived. E.g. email,
 *	instant messaging, for which there is a sense of interactivity and
 *	urgency (user waiting for output).
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_OAM
 *	"Operations, Administration, and Management", medium delay tolerant,
 *	low-medium loss tolerant, elastic & inelastic flows, variable size.
 *	E.g. VPN tunnels.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_AV
 *	"Multimedia Audio/Video Streaming", medium delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate
 *	and size. E.g. video and audio playback with buffering.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RV
 *	"Responsive Multimedia Audio/Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, variable packet interval, rate and size.
 *	E.g. screen sharing.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VI
 *	"Interactive Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium loss tolerant,
 *	elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate & size. E.g.
 *	video telephony.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_SIG
 *	"Signaling", low delay tolerant, low loss tolerant, inelastic flow,
 *	jitter tolerant, rate is bursty but short, variable size. E.g. SIP.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VO
 *	"Interactive Voice", very low delay tolerant, very low loss tolerant,
 *	inelastic flow, constant packet rate, somewhat fixed size.
 *	E.g. VoIP.

/* Start the main loop; exits if OC_CMD_CANCEL is received on cmd_fd or
   the remote site aborts. */
/* The first (privdata) argument to each of these functions is either
   the privdata argument provided to openconnect_vpninfo_new_with_cbdata(),
   or if that argument was NULL then it'll be the vpninfo itself. */
/* When the server's certificate fails validation via the normal means,
   this function is called with the offending certificate along with
   a textual reason for the failure (which may not be translated, if
   it comes directly from OpenSSL, but will be if it is rejected for
   "certificate does not match hostname", because that check is done
   in OpenConnect and *is* translated). The function shall return zero
   if the certificate is (or has in the past been) explicitly accepted
   by the user, and non-zero to abort the connection. */
/* On a successful connection, the server may provide us with a new XML
   configuration file. This contains the list of servers that can be
   chosen by the user to connect to, amongst other stuff that we mostly
   ignore. By "new", we mean that the SHA1 indicated by the server does
   not match the SHA1 set with the openconnect_set_xmlsha1() above. If
   they don't match, or openconnect_set_xmlsha1() has not been called,
   then the new XML is downloaded and this function is invoked. */
/* Handle an authentication form, requesting input from the user.

/* Logging output which the user *may* want to see. */
/* Callback to allow binding a newly created socket's file descriptor to
   a specific interface, e.g. with SO_BINDTODEVICE. This tells the kernel
   not to route the traffic in question over the VPN tunnel. */
/* Callback for obtaining traffic stats via OC_CMD_STATS.

/* SSL certificate capabilities. openconnect_has_pkcs11_support() means that we

  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for
  Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950
  (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and rfc1952 (gzip format).
*/
/* !__APPLE__ */
/* !__APPLE__ */
/*
    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
  memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in the case of corrupted input.

 plus a few kilobytes for small objects. For example, if you want to reduce
 the default memory requirements from 256K to 128K, compile with

 Of course this will generally degrade compression (there's no free lunch).

   The memory requirements for inflate are (in bytes) 1 << windowBits
 that is, 32K for windowBits=15 (default value) plus about 7 kilobytes
 for small objects.
