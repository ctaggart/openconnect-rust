   iconv_t, 1. in order to eliminate the risk that the user gets compilation
   errors because some other system header file includes /usr/include/iconv.h
   which defines iconv_t or declares iconv after this file, 2. when compiling
   for LIBICONV_PLUG, we need the proper iconv_t type in order to produce
   binary compatible code.
   But gcc's #include_next is not portable. Thus, once libiconv's iconv.h
   has been installed in /usr/local/include, there is no way any more to
   include the original /usr/include/iconv.h. We simply have to get away
   without it.
   Ad 1. The risk that a system header file does
   #include "iconv.h"  or  #include_next "iconv.h"
   is small. They all do #include <iconv.h>.
   Ad 2. The iconv_t type is a pointer type in all cases I have seen. (It
   has to be a scalar type because (iconv_t)(-1) is a possible return value
   from iconv_open().) */

  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for
  Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950
  (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and rfc1952 (gzip format).

    /*
    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
  memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in the case of corrupted input.
