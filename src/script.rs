 * The rune type below is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural
 * ``unsigned long'' or ``long''.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
 * unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also wint_t must be no narrower than
 * wchar_t, and should also be able to hold all members of the largest
 * character set plus one extra value (WEOF). wint_t must be at least 16 bits.

 * Network Service Type for option SO_NET_SERVICE_TYPE
 *
 * The vast majority of sockets should use Best Effort that is the default
 * Network Service Type. Other Network Service Types have to be used only if
 * the traffic actually matches the description of the Network Service Type.
 *
 * Network Service Types do not represent priorities but rather describe
 * different categories of delay, jitter and loss parameters.
 * Those parameters may influence protocols from layer 4 protocols like TCP
 * to layer 2 protocols like Wi-Fi. The Network Service Type can determine
 * how the traffic is queued and scheduled by the host networking stack and
 * by other entities on the network like switches and routers. For example
 * for Wi-Fi, the Network Service Type can select the marking of the
 * layer 2 packet with the appropriate WMM Access Category.
 *
 * There is no point in attempting to game the system and use
 * a Network Service Type that does not correspond to the actual
 * traffic characteristic but one that seems to have a higher precedence.
 * The reason is that for service classes that have lower tolerance
 * for delay and jitter, the queues size is lower than for service
 * classes that are more tolerant to delay and jitter.
 *
 * For example using a voice service type for bulk data transfer will lead
 * to disastrous results as soon as congestion happens because the voice
 * queue overflows and packets get dropped. This is not only bad for the bulk
 * data transfer but it is also bad for VoIP apps that legitimately are using
 * the voice  service type.
 *
 * The characteristics of the Network Service Types are based on the service
 * classes defined in RFC 4594 "Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service
 * Classes"
 *
 * When system detects the outgoing interface belongs to a DiffServ domain
 * that follows the recommendation of the IETF draft "Guidelines for DiffServ to
 * IEEE 802.11 Mapping", the packet will marked at layer 3 with a DSCP value
 * that corresponds to Network Service Type.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BE
 *	"Best Effort", unclassified/standard.  This is the default service
 *	class and cover the majority of the traffic.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_BK
 *	"Background", high delay tolerant, loss tolerant. elastic flow,
 *	variable size & long-lived. E.g: non-interactive network bulk transfer
 *	like synching or backup.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RD
 *	"Responsive Data", a notch higher than "Best Effort", medium delay
 *	tolerant, elastic & inelastic flow, bursty, long-lived. E.g. email,
 *	instant messaging, for which there is a sense of interactivity and
 *	urgency (user waiting for output).
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_OAM
 *	"Operations, Administration, and Management", medium delay tolerant,
 *	low-medium loss tolerant, elastic & inelastic flows, variable size.
 *	E.g. VPN tunnels.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_AV
 *	"Multimedia Audio/Video Streaming", medium delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate
 *	and size. E.g. video and audio playback with buffering.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_RV
 *	"Responsive Multimedia Audio/Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium
 *	loss tolerant, elastic flow, variable packet interval, rate and size.
 *	E.g. screen sharing.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VI
 *	"Interactive Video", low delay tolerant, low-medium loss tolerant,
 *	elastic flow, constant packet interval, variable rate & size. E.g.
 *	video telephony.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_SIG
 *	"Signaling", low delay tolerant, low loss tolerant, inelastic flow,
 *	jitter tolerant, rate is bursty but short, variable size. E.g. SIP.
 *
 * NET_SERVICE_TYPE_VO
 *	"Interactive Voice", very low delay tolerant, very low loss tolerant,
 *	inelastic flow, constant packet rate, somewhat fixed size.
 *	E.g. VoIP.

 *
 * To handle both cases transparently the macros below
 * should be used instead of hard coding an ASN1_ITEM
 * pointer in a structure.

 * The structure will look like this:
 *
 * typedef struct SOMETHING_st {

 * } SOMETHING;

 * SOMETHING somevar = {...,ASN1_ITEM_ref(X509),...};
 *
 * and the actual pointer extracted with:
 *
 * const ASN1_ITEM *it = ASN1_ITEM_ptr(somevar.iptr);
 *
 * Finally an ASN1_ITEM pointer can be extracted from an
 * appropriate reference with: ASN1_ITEM_rptr(X509). This
 * would be used when a function takes an ASN1_ITEM * argument.

  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for
  Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950
  (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and rfc1952 (gzip format).

    /*
    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
  memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in the case of corrupted input.

   for LIBICONV_PLUG, we need the proper iconv_t type in order to produce
   binary compatible code.

   has been installed in /usr/local/include, there is no way any more to
   include the original /usr/include/iconv.h. We simply have to get away
   without it.

   #include "iconv.h"  or  #include_next "iconv.h"
   is small. They all do #include <iconv.h>.
